<<<<<<< HEAD
Whether walking through urban neighborhoods or going on nature hikes, the diversity of the natural world surrounds us. Our lab researches the origin and maintenance of this species diversity. To answer these questions, we integrate field work, genomics, and experiments.

Our research program focuses on three major aims.

# Macroevolutionary patterns of species diversity
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/species.png" alt="macro" caption="One reason why species diversity might vary is because speciation rate, or how quickly new species form, also varies. This variation can be seen here across lizards and snakes." %}
When we think of mammals, we might first think about chimps, bears, and elephants. But, more than 60% of mammal species are either some kind of rodent or bat. This is an example of a compelling pattern found across the tree of life: some types of species are more common than others. Using lizards and snakes, we are studying the potential causes for this pattern.

Work done in collaboration with [Dan Rabosky](http://www.raboskylab.org/) at University of Michigan.

# The evolution of asexual reproduction in lizards
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/lizards.png" alt="lizards" caption="The cost of males: an asexually-reproducing population grows twice as fast as a sexually-reproducing population because males cannot bear children." %}
Sexual reproduction has many disadvantages. For example, sexual populations grow half as fast as asexual populations (see above). Given this, you might think asexual reproduction is the norm. But, most multicellular species, including our own, reproduce sexually. Why do so many species reproduce sexually if it is so seemingly disadvantageous? One hypothesis is that sex evolved because sex generates genetic variation, and genetic variation fuels evolution. In fact, some call asexuality an evolutionary dead-end. To test this idea, we are comparing closely-related lizard species that have evolved from producing sexually to asexually.

# The adaptive radiation of desert plants
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/encelia1.png" alt="this is a placeholder image" caption="The desert habitat of _E. asperifolia_ (left) and the dune habitat of _E. ventorum_ (right). Where the two habitats meet, the two species hybridize." %}
_Encelia_ is a radiation of about 20 plant species, most of which live in the open deserts of the southwestern United States and Baja California. Each species of _Encelia_ shows adaptations to the different habitats in which they are found. Interestingly, they evolved these differences even while hybridizing freely with each other -- wherever any two species meet, hybrids form, with no evidence that they are sterile or less fit than their parents. We are researching the evolutionary history of these species and their natural hybrid zones to determine how these species formed and how they are maintained.

# Tool development & sharing data
As part of our research, we regularly develop new pipelines for preparing and analyzing high-throughput sequencing data, including transcriptome, target capture, and ddRAD data. We strive to make both our code and our data publicly available via our [GitHub](https://github.com/singhal?tab=repositories) page and online databases like NCBI SRA.

One of the fundamental units in biology is the species. Our lab studies how new species form and are maintained. To answer these questions, we integrate field work, genomics, and experiments.

Our research program currently has three main areas.

## Biodiversity of Australian & Brazilian squamates
Squamates, or lizards and snakes, comprise about 10,000 species, or 15% of all vertebrate species on Earth. In this research, we seek to understand

## The evolution of parthenogenetic species of lizards

## The adaptive radiation of desert plants


## Tool development & sharing data
