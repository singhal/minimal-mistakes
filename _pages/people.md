## Sonal Singhal
![image-right]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/sonal.jpg){: .align-right .width-third} I have been a professor at CSU Dominguez Hills since Fall 2017. I came to CSUDH via Ohio, with numerous stops for schooling and training along the way. My research interests are using genetics to reconstruct the evolutionary history of natural populations, and although I enjoy all aspects of research, my favorite part is doing data analysis. My teaching interests include genetics, ecology & evolution, and practical computing. Outside of school, you can find me cooking overly complicated meals, reading books, trying to do a pull-up, and spending time with my family & pups.

My expected graduation date is Spring 2020. I currently am researching the hybridization between the desert plants _E. asperifolia_ and _E. ventorum_. More generally, I am interested in further understanding how aquatic organism are responding to changing environments.

I am currently researching the genetic variation between two small, rare, populations of plant species found in Baja California (_E. densifolia_ and _E. ravenii_) and testing for evidence of gene flow. More generally, I am interested in plants along with conservation and restoration and conservation genetics. Outside of school I like to go to electronic music festivals (my all-time favorite DJ is Deadmau5). I enjoy running, CrossFit, reading, playing videogames (my favorite at the moment is Cuphead), longboarding and hiking! My favorite book is _Origin_ by Dan Brown, Favorite song to study to is "My Pet Coelacanth" by Deadmau5. My favorite biome is the desert! 

## Liz Solis
![image-right]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/liz.jpg){: .align-right .width-third} I’m a junior at Cal State Dominguez Hills and I will be graduating Spring 2020. I’m a biology major with the emphasis on ecology and environmental studies. Currently, I am researching hybridization between the desert plants _E. palmeri_ and _E. ventorum_. I am generally interested in conservation research, forest restoration, tropical ecology, and behavioral ecology (specifically on venomous spiders). Outside from school, I like to spend my time with my best friend. Normally we watch a movie, bake cookies, or grab a bite somewhere. I also like to spend time with my sister and her kids (when her kids aren’t in school!). Usually we go to Disneyland, or we’ll plan out a day with kid activities.
