## Sonal Singhal
![image-right]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/sonal.jpg){: .align-right .width-third} I have been a professor at CSU Dominguez Hills since Fall 2017. I came to CSUDH via Ohio, with numerous stops for schooling and training along the way. My research uses genetics to reconstruct the evolutionary history of natural populations. Although I enjoy all aspects of research, my favorite part is data analysis. My teaching interests include genetics, ecology & evolution, and practical computing. Outside of school, you can find me cooking overly complicated meals, reading books, trying to do a pull-up, and spending time with my family & pups.

## Mayra Padilla Flores
![image-right]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/mayra.jpg){: .align-right .width-third} I am currently a fourth-year student at Dominguez Hills, majoring in Cell & Molecular Biology. My expected graduation date is Spring 2020. I currently am researching the hybridization between the desert plants _E. asperifolia_ and _E. ventorum_. More generally, I am interested in further understanding how aquatic organisms are responding to changing environments. When not in school, I like going to the beach, snorkeling, and spending time with my five year old daughter Leslie.

## Josh De Vera

I am currently researching the evolution of PRDM9 in lizards and snakes. In general, I am interested in genetic research and its application to human medicine. Outside of school, I spend most of my time working as an emergency room technician and any remainder time playing strategy games with my friends.

## Andrea Hernandez
![image-right]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/andrea.png){: .align-right .width-third} I will be graduating with my Bachelor of Science in Ecology & Environmental Science in Fall of 2020. I am currently researching the genetic variation between two small, rare, populations of plant species found in Baja California (_E. densifolia_ and _E. ravenii_) and testing for evidence of gene flow. More generally, I am interested in plants along with conservation & restoration and conservation genetics. Outside of school I like to go to electronic music festivals (my all-time favorite DJ is Deadmau5). I enjoy running, CrossFit, reading, playing videogames (my favorite at the moment is Cuphead), longboarding and hiking! My favorite book is _Origin_ by Dan Brown, my favorite song to study to is "My Pet Coelacanth" by Deadmau5, and my favorite biome is the desert!

## Nicole Roberts
![image-right]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/nicole.png){: .align-right .width-third} Currently, I am a Masters student researching Ecological Niche Modelling in North American placental mammals. One joyous discovery I've made so far is how much I love statistics and programming. I plan to pursue conservation work using GIS and Remote Sensing and hope to better understand how climate change and human disturbances are affecting our world. Outside of graduate school, I am a trained opera singer (Lyric Soprano), short story writer, amateur LOTR enthusiast, and avid Instant Pot cooker. I love spending time with my family and two snakes, Noodle and Sausage.

## Liz Solis
![image-right]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/liz.jpg){: .align-right .width-third} I’m a junior, and I will be graduating Spring 2020. I’m a biology major with the emphasis on Ecology & Environmental studies. Currently, I am researching hybridization between the desert plants _E. palmeri_ and _E. ventorum_. I am generally interested in conservation research, forest restoration, tropical ecology, and behavioral ecology (specifically on venomous spiders). Outside from school, I like to spend my time with my best friend. Normally we watch a movie, bake cookies, or grab a bite somewhere. I also like to spend time with my sister and her kids (when her kids aren’t in school!). Usually we go to Disneyland, or we’ll plan out a day with kid activities.

## John Wrath
![image-right]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/john.jpg){: .align-right .width-third} I am a senior majoring in Cell & Molecular Biology.  I joined the Singhal lab in March of 2018 and am currently studying patterns of genetic diversity in lizard species.  I was born and raised on the island of O’ahu, which gave me an appreciation for both the beauty of the natural world, as well as the profound impact humans have on it.  In my free time, I am an avid reader, guitarist, and PC gamer.
